# polydb_openapi
generation of the polydb openapi definition file

To generate the html documentation you need to
  * clone
    * https://github.com/apaffenholz/oas3-api-snippet-enricher
    * https://github.com/apaffenholz/openapi-snippet
   into the same folder as this repository (or adjust the path in bin/generate_polydb_openapi_doc.sh)
  * run bin/generate_polydb_openapi_doc.sh
 
The doc will be in out/polydb-rest.html. You can give a different file name as argument to the shell script.
